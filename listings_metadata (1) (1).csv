I’m not going to try to convince you to stay at this Airbnb but instead address the issues that guests have complained about in reviews. This listing is priced accurately and cheap because there isn’t much besides 2 king beds, bathroom, washer/dryer. There is a bit of noise from upstairs when people walk around but usually no later than 11 PM. Please keep in mind when reviewing that you’re not paying very much to stay here. If you’re going to complain, please stay elsewhere. The space Full access to lower level and yard. Unfortunately, there’s no kitchen on the lower level and not much furniture, but I hope to have it fully furnished soon. Perfect if you’re looking for a private spot to relax and sleep for the night. FYI: I’ve listed this as a 2 bedroom space because both rooms have beds. However, for the sake of not misleading my future guests, I’ve considered the main room as one of the bedrooms. Check-in: 7pm Check-out: 12pm If you need an earlier check-in, let me know and we might be able to work it out. The reason it’s 7pm is so I have time to clean before each guest. Heating is provided through three space heaters which adequately heat the entire space. Please keep in mind that this is a finished basement and not a hotel. I’ve received a few negative ratings because there’s not much besides the two king beds and other essentials. Also, there is a potential of noise because I like to play music and the floor upstairs has some squeaky spots. We will try to be as quiet as we can after 11pm. Please keep these things in mind before reviewing my place! Thank you! Other things to note There is a potential for noise because the basement ceiling isn’t insulated.

The Nelson 151 Trail provides a convenient way to sample Nelson County's many wineries,cideries,distilleries,and breweries along scenic Route 151 plus many more scattered around the county. The house is over 100 years old and has been thoroughly modernized. The unincorporated Village of Afton was established in 1859 with the opening of a train station and Post Office. Richmond families escaped the heat of summer at the nearby Afton House Hotel. Air-conditioning changed habits and the Hotel was converted to a home that unfortunately burned to the ground in 1963. The freight station shipped tons of fruit from the surrounding orchards. The Albermarle Pippin (or Newton) apple was made famous by Thomas Jefferson and was one of the first apples exported to the U.K. when Queen Victoria lifted import duties on Virginia fruit to encourage the availability of her favorite apple. The train station was closed and demolished more than 50 years ago with a replica built as an attorney's office. The original rail line to Crozet's tunnel was replaced in the early 1940s with another line about 50 feet to the south. Amtrak's Cardinal still comes through 3 times a week in both directions during the afternoon making its way between NY-Chicago and unscheduled empty coal trains move westward with varying degrees of frequency. We estimated from 0-3 times per day on average and most often during the day but they also come through at night,there is,as stated,no schedule. The active track lies about a football field's length below the house. In 2021 we sold our Shenandoah Valley home and now reside in another cottage on the property. We also travel frequently in our little RV but are are always available to answer questions: local history,hiking,biking,restaurants,etc.,and have a crew of people to call on should any emergency needs arise. For correct pricing,when making a booking request please describe the total # in your party,the number,and ages of any children traveling with you. Dogs - (1) small to medium sized well behaved dog may be approved in advance along with the payment of the pet fee (50 per dog/per week max.) Ask for rates if you have a 2nd dog. If your pet is crate trained and you would prefer to leave yours at home but bring some bedding since none is provided. We also provide dog waste bags. We consider our home dog friendly for responsible pet owners. Please bring a blanket to protect our furniture if your dog is used to being on furniture. Taxes Airbnb collects and remits only the combined state and county sales tax of 5.3% The Nelson County Transient Occupancy of %5 is not collected by Airbnb but is included in our posted rates for remittance to the county. Stays of 90+ days are tax exempt. Guest access Guests have access to the entire house and 1 acre +/- property with the exception of the crawl space,eaves and the tool shed. There is a small storage shed with combo-lock available for guests to store items like skis or bicycles. Other things to note Afton is considered quiet countryside,however,the house is 120 yards from an active rail line. There are 6 Amtrak passenger trains that pass through per week plus the occasional empty coal train or freight. Snow and ice during the winter can block the driveway so we provide a parking area along the primary road when weather threatens; we have no way to guarantee when the driveway will be plowed/safe. Stink bugs plague the east slope of the Blue Ridge for a couple of weeks in the fall during daylight hours. An afternoon roundup with the dustbuster and dumping that outside is all it takes to keep the house clear of the little buggers. Slightly more annoying are the Asian Lady Beetles aka the Harlequin Ladybird. They look like Lady Bugs but they're not. They sneak into the house in the fall and then try to find their way out ever sunny warm day until spring. Once again a late afternoon vacuum and release out of doors will provide a quiet night. This list may read like a nightmare but every house on the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge deals with most of what is written here. snow/ice/stink bugs and lady beetles. The train probably sets us apart. A lot of folks find the train exciting or charming;to each his own.

Guests from all walks of life can unplug & recharge at this haven of solace nestled in the serene foothills of the Virginia Blue Ridge mountains. The spacious farmhouse is fully equipped and modestly furnished, with light-filled living spaces flowing through to the outdoors. The main kitchen-dining-living area comfortably hosts group gatherings, while the large bedrooms offer plenty of privacy. The space Come to the quiet. Our recently renovated 100 year old farmhouse sits well-appointed in a clearing of pasture surrounded by 80 acres of preserved forest. The outdoors beckon, inviting you to immerse your senses in the beauty of the natural surroundings. Enjoy coffee on the front porch swing, a gentle 1/4 mile walk along Ivy Creek, or a 1.2 mile loop over up the back ridge, contemplative moments by the stream, warming your bones by a late afternoon fire. Get back to basics as you focus on rest, connection, and comfort in these tranquil surroundings. The open floor plan in the kitchen-dining-living area connects to the screened porch, back yard, and mudroom. This area can be closed off from the rear hallway, which leads to one full bathroom, the stairwell, and first floor master bedroom. The second floor holds another full bathroom, the remaining bedrooms, and a small sitting area. At this small working farm you may observe permaculture and agroforestry practices such as riparian buffer restoration, gardens, and livestock. Whether you choose to stay nestled within the 100 acres of our forests and pastures or venture out to explore the myriad offerings of the surrounding area, our wish is that you make the most of your time away from daily life and find ways reconnect with rhythms and activities that feed your spirit. The quiet is calling. Guest access You will have full access to all living areas of the farmhouse and the surrounding landscape including the backyard, fire circles, garden, stream-side areas, and forest footpaths. When hiking and enjoying the outdoors, demonstrate respect for your natural surroundings at all times. Please remain on the paths at all times and do not disturb any livestock or wildlife you may encounter. Guests accept all responsibility for any failure to exercise healthy caution or use good judgment. Caretaker quarters, farm buildings and equipment are off-limits to guests. Our livestock are friendly and somewhat curious, but please respect their pasture and always keep a fence between them and you. Do touch or climb over fences, as some livestock fencing is electric and board fences are old and unable to support weight. If you make use of the fire circles, ensure that flames are completely extinguished before leaving them unattended. While the property offers many intriguing objects for contemplation, guests may not remove any found objects, no matter how small, from the property. Take only memories and leave only footprints. Other things to note While deeply restorative, the forests and fields may also harbor hazards such as ticks, poison ivy, and (while rare) snakes and black bears. Prepare appropriately with bug repellent spray, long pants and sleeves, and hats; and be bear aware: In the unlikely event that you encounter a bear, do not run - it could prompt a chase. If in a group, stay together. Calmly leave the area, while making a bit of noise so the bear will not be surprised by you. If the bear has seen you, back away slowly while facing the bear and speaking softly. https:// www.dgif.virginia. gov/ bear-aware/ We ask that you do your best to leave the place as clean as you found it. An additional cleaning fee may be requested if house or premises are left in an unsatisfactory manner.

The cottage and property are very serene and quiet. Ideal location: Only 1.5 miles to Route 151. About 3.5 miles hiking provides access to the Appalachian Trail from the cottage. Explore local wineries, breweries, and cideries. The space Located in the George Washington National Forest, Gracewood is a retreat from the mental and emotional activity of everyday life. This eco-friendly house was recently remodeled as a comfortable setting for couples or small families who want a break. We hold meditation retreats here twice a year, so it works well for a writer or artist or a contemplative to do a solo retreat. Upstairs is a full modern kitchen with new appliances. We made the cottage so nice that one of us could live there comfortably if we chose to do that. There is also a dining set and a comfortable full size futon couch. (Many futons are not that comfortable. We own an organic mattress company, so the mattress and frame are the best.) Downstairs is a queen size mattress and two Ekorness chairs (stressless chairs). We use Savvy Rest organic bedding. Within 12 minutes are several breweries, wineries, and a cidery. The property is 39+ acres, with 1/2 mile along Meriwether Creek. The volume of water varies with the season, but the feeling of energy is always powerful, calming, and clearing. There are about two miles of private trails suitable for hiking or running. Trails are well marked, and a map is available. Over the course of ten years we have seen a few bears, raccoons, groundhogs, bats, lots of box turtles, a few snakes, a wide variety of birds, along with plenty of deer and other wildlife. We took pictures of what appeared to be bobcat tracks one winter, but we haven't caught sight of the nocturnals. Please note that there is no television. Internet is fiber optic and reliable, but cell service inside the cottage is intermittent, although right outside it is usually pretty reliable. So it's relatively easy to unplug. Also note that the main queen size bed is downstairs, and the bathroom is upstairs if you get up in the night. We also have a full size futon upstairs if needed. (If you need to use it as a bed, we ask you to let us know ahead of time so we can prepare it for you, or show you how to use it so as not to ding the walls.) Upon your arrival you'll see that our house is close to the cottage, but there is landscaping next to both buildings; and the cottage is actually quite private. It's likely that you won't see anyone on our 40 acres during your stay. There are wonderful musical events spring to fall. Skiing at Wintergreen in the winter. Live music at our charming farmer's market in Nellysford. Regarding COVID preparation, we clean thoroughly, wash all the soft materials, and we particularly clean the hard surfaces and then disinfect them. We pay the cleaning folks well, and they do a really good job. :) For visiting nurses or doctors looking for a longer stay, ask about our longer term discounted rates. Guest access It's a beautiful 3.5 mile walk to the Appalachian Trail and from there less than a mile to Humpback Rocks. It's uphill, so you need to be in good shape. Other things to note 2 Miles well maintained walking trails, 1/2 mile along a bubbling creek. Serenity beyond words. Breweries and Wineries galore. Nice restaurants nearby. 4.5 mile walk to Humpback Rocks on the Blue Ridge Parkway, 2.5 miles to Shenandoah National Park. Savvy Rest organic bedding throughout, although the main mattress on the Murphy bed could not tolerate the weight of an organic mattress. The bedding on top is all certified organic.

You'll find plenty of parking adjacent to the cottage. The pool is shared with the apartment so, please, no skinny dipping 😬 Pool will be closed Nov. 1 until spring. Other things to note Your cottage is what you rent, and we pride ourselves on giving 100% respect for all guests’ privacy. We are always happy to chat with guests if you feel social, but understand if you want to remain 'away' from people on your trip. The road can be heard from the front porch, but not an issue from inside the house with the windows closed. There is more traffic noise when the leaves are off the trees in the winter, one of the drawbacks to being so convenient to Route 29. We take great care to ensure every fabric surface is washed after each stay including shower curtains, all bedding and duvets. All hard surfaces and furniture are sanitized between each stay. Additionally, mountain life draws ladybugs and stink bugs and is not a reflection of cleanliness but rather a normal part of what to expect in this area. We take protecting our guests seriously and value keeping a very clean space for you to enjoy. About the Hosts Hi! We’re Bobbi and Keith. We’ve been renting on Airbnb since 2015 and love country life and all things outdoors, whether it’s hiking, kayaking, gardening, or tending to our goats, chickens, and cows. We love to travel, but just as happy hanging out on our porch with our two dogs listening to music and enjoying a cold beverage in the evenings. We love for people to experience Nelson County and everything that our wonderful home has to offer. That's why we started our first Airbnb, with plans to eventually expand up the mountain on our property to accommodate more guests. We’re always interested to know what makes our guests happy when they are here but value their need for privacy. If you have any comments, suggestions, or issues, we would love to know what they are and have left a comment book for such things and are only a call away. Time away with friends and loved ones is essential to a good and productive life! We really want to help our guests feel comfortable enough that they have only to worry about what beer they will drink next.

The space Tranquil Estate is a very special place where the big sky meets the Blue Ridge mountains. We moved here because Charlottesville is small city that has farm to table values and a countryside which makes you feel like you’re on vacation. The decor is industrial farmhouse and all of the amenities are new; including the beds! We will leave a few necessities in the kitchen like coffee, tea, salt seasonings and olive oil. There is a Keurig and a drip coffee maker with coffee pods. There is a new cuisinart induction cooktop and a new cuisinart fryer, toaster, and baking oven. There are two mini-splits. There is a window AC unit you can control along with ceiling fans and stationary fans. Let us know if you are too warm or cold so we can make you comfortable! We have a huge 10+ acre field with horses and cows over the fence. It is a very peaceful property. There is a large table to work on - perhaps write that novel sitting in the back of your head. The property also is the perfect place to paint en plein air. Bring wood, paper and marshmallows for the fire pit! Sorry, pets are not allowed. Base price covers two people. Guest access You’ll have the cottage to yourself and there are tall evergreens separating the view between houses so it is private. Since it is a small farm you may see me out and about as I take care of the property and animals. We are mindful that you are here to rest and relax and always do our best to accommodate guests needs. The dogs are in and out all day but if you prefer not to see them just say so and we will do our best to keep them inside. Their names are Foster the Basset Hound, and Pippa our young Corgi. Other things to note Horses: Ruby the paint horse is 10 years old. The small black and white pony is named Daisy-Mae. Both are sweethearts and very beautiful unless it is muddy...ugh. Sometimes they are in a paddock up close to the cottage which is really fun for our guests. They are kept in an electric fence but love a visit. They enjoy real food like apples and carrots and hold your hand FLAT when giving them these treats. Fire Pit Stuff: Bring wood and paper for your fire pit and the MARSHMALLOWS!!! If you forget something just ask- we probably have it! First time Airbnb users need to know that being a part of the Airbnb family is super unique. We have traveled the world this way. We welcome new people when we see them enjoying our property. When we travel, our hosts are those who share their restaurants and “must see and do” information not found on line.Meeting new people is what Airbnb is all about- not just staying at a place- you’re staying in a part of a home.

We have chickens,ducks,horses,cows,an expansive garden,and a vineyard. We have a livestock guardian dog who lives with our poultry and ensures their nighttime safety. While we allow guests to bring dogs,"we expect dogs to be well behaved and to not come towards our livestock. If a dog becomes a problem we reserve the right to ask that it remains leashed.

(Up to 9 at $25/night per extra guest). For all of you out there who enjoy a homestay experience that is delightfully unlike a hotel, we've divided our enormous old house just outside of Charlottesville into two completely self-contained homes. 12 min to downtown, 15 min to Monticello or UVA. Convenient to the region's best wineries and right off one of the most beautiful scenic byways in Virginia. Sunny walkout deck with grill. The space Please note: the price for this space may vary depending on the day of the week and the season of the year. Please put in your specific dates - the price shown when you search without dates may not be the price you get for your specific dates! We have an enormous sprawling old house just outside of Charlottesville, and have divided into two completely self-contained homes. Your space is completely private, and we will be right next door and are available for any questions or needs that may arise. The spacious house has everything you need to serve as a home base from which to enjoy Charlottesvile and the surrounding countryside. The feel of the house is vintage cottage/barn. To the chagrin of those who gravitate toward the newly built, this is an older home and is lovingly maintained yet decidedly old fashioned in character. Besides the Great Room with its fireplace and exposed beams, there is an overlooking loft den, one extremely large bedroom (king bed) with a walk-out deck, and two smaller bedrooms (one queen, one full), all upstairs. The loft den has two day beds. Each bed has an excellent mattress and sheets are either cotton or vegan silk (bamboo fiber). The fully-equipped kitchen has a slate floor and soapstone counters with a big old fashioned sink. Wood/slate floors throughout most of the house. Washer and dryer on premises. There is only one television in the house, located in the Great Room. Accessing media on your personal devices is easy and fast, and the television reception is basic but adequate. There is a fantastic library and plenty of common spaces for enjoying the company of your family and friends. The quiet beautiful neighborhood streets are perfect for walks and runs, and the Rivanna River and a riverside trail is a short walk away. Downtown C-ville and UVA are twelve minute drives away. Note that our neighborhood is a suburban/rural one - though we're very close to town, the feel of the place is very quiet, with woods and countryside abounding. Not a great choice for those in search of an urban experience! Lastly, this is an old fashioned house built in the 60's and has not been updated- expect to find some loving wear, quaint aging and charming patina both inside and outside. Important note about the layout of the house: The full bathroom is situated upstairs between two of the bedrooms, Jack and Jill style. If you're comfortable passing through a bedroom on the way to the shower, this is a fine layout. If, however, you are a more private group, this might not be such a good fit. Note also that the vintage, shabby chic aesthetic of our house extends to the bathroom. While very clean and spacious, it is also very basic - none of the bells and whistles of more sleek and modern salles de baines. You will find, however, that the books I've selected for the bathroom are top notch single sitting reads. Lastly, a note about insect life. If you don't hail from the Mid Atlantic or Southern parts of the US, you may not be familiar with the presence of the invasive species of stink bug which has flourished here. You are very likely to to encounter at least a couple in the house, despite my best efforts to banish them outdoors. Note that our house is an older one in a rural area, and that we have a more thriving insect life than the air-tight homes in urban areas. If encountering a bug is something that would detract from the pleasure of your stay, this is not the house for you! I am scrupulous about ridding the house of all insect life when I clean the space, but bugs do have their ways of coming in. Guest access Guests have access to the whole house. The space is yours to enjoy, and everything in it is yours to use. Books, instruments, kitchen supplies, etc. The only space not accessible is back patio, which our family uses for outdoor dining and garden projects. However, you are more than welcome to use the patio to get out into the large yard and to access the stairs that lead up to the deck. The yard is shared; you may see us out there also. Other things to note This home has a very good library and delightful common spaces for spending time with family and friends. The atmosphere of this house is wonderfully vintage and shabby chic. if you're looking for a modern, luxurious, mint condition space for your group, this house is not a good fit.

The University of Virginia and Monticello are each just a short drive, and the home is convenient to the Monticello Wine Trail and Skyline Drive. The space There are a few stairs down to your private patio and entrance to the 1-bedroom modern basement apartment. The couch (recently upgraded, gray in color, and have photographer scheduled so reflects in listing photos) turns into a full-sized bed and the queen bed is located in the bedroom, where you'll also find a spacious bathroom (with great water pressure!). We've had many guests who rave about the bed, especially those who love a more firm mattress. There is a fully stocked kitchen with a full size fridge, a dishwasher, and coffee maker. There is a 50 Smart TV and high speed Ting internet. Although we don't have cable",you can access Netflix,Amazon Prime and YouTube from the Smart TV. The apartment is perfect for a getaway for two but we can accommodate up to four. The main part of the house (top 2 floors) has its own separate entrance and is also listed on airbnb on a much more limited basis. If you are looking to bring a larger party please check out that listing (Belmont Home with Hot Tub - Steps from Downtown). Please note the Hot Tub is NOT available for guests in the basement apartment. The heat/AC control is in the Upstairs Home,but we have remote access to adjust temperature. We consistently monitor the AirBnB app so quickly can adjust temperature upon guest request. While there is no reserved parking,there is typically plentiful street parking,including the street directly across from the apartment. You may NOT park in the Belmont Lofts parking lot or in the reserved spaces in the back of the house. Please note that do have a security camera of the exterior of the home,on the front porch and another that is focused on the parking area for the upstairs home. The cameras are motion activated and record audio and video. Guest access You'll be in the basement apartment and have use of the private patio in front of the apartment. You will not have access to the upstairs or the back patio unless you have also rented that space. Other things to note We do live upstairs,so you may hear footsteps from time to time,as you would with any basement/garden unit. When we are out of town we do hosts guests in the upstairs home. We're happy to greet you or leave you to yourself to enjoy your stay. We live near a train,but it is incredibly quiet! We rarely even hear it unless we are outside on our balcony. Because of our proximity to the hospital,the train must go slowly and is not allowed to sound any whistles,so you may not even know it is there. What you usually hear are the sounds of birds chirping and the faint hum of music when bands play at the Amphitheater on the Downtown Mall. You'll have a private patio,and a serene space on our quiet street. Our neighbors are terrific and many will happily tour you around their gardens or welcome you to the neighborhood.

Perfect for a romantic getaway, a work retreat, a stop through town on the way to another location, a small family, or a group of friends participating in the many events held in Charlottesville- weddings, concerts, triathlons. Accommodates 1-4 people looking for a relaxed, stylish, modern and comfortable place to stay. The space Looking for a centrally located, unique and quiet home base during your visit to Charlottesville? Oxford Cottage is a modern Tiny House. Built in 2014 and updated in 2020, it is larger than a standard hotel suite and provides everything you need for a comfortable stay. Tall ceilings, glowing natural light, and a modern aesthetic with fun decor, the space just feels good. The building is energy efficient and insulated and feels like a tree house. Situated behind the main house on a .18 acre lot in the City, you can enjoy a contactless stay and get to everything Charlottesville has to offer within minutes. There is plenty of space for 1-2 people, but 4 adventurous souls could stay and be cozy. The beds and furnishings are comfortable and well appointed and linens and towels are provided. There is central heating and air, a ceiling fan and an air purifier. There is no TV, but there is free, super fast fiber Wifi so you could stream away on your phone, iPad, etc. The kitchenette has a microwave, 3 burner induction cook top, crock pot, toaster oven and a refrigerator/freezer. Kitchenette is well appointed for simple meals and there are dishes and silverware, mugs, cups and wine glasses for up to 4 people. One important note about the stairs to the loft, is that they are steep and you will need to take your time going up and down. Use the handrails and watch your noggin at the top. It's easier to come down them backwards, like you would a ladder on a boat. Toddlers and folks with knee or hip issues should not use them. (We can provide a safety gate if you have a little kiddo). You can also just decide to sleep on the futon in the living area if you do not wish to navigate the stairs. They are sturdy and well built, but they are not a standard stair case. We have taken care to build and maintain a low impact building. Please turn off the lights when leaving the cottage and be aware of water usage. Please do not flush anything other than the usual and toilet paper (especially condoms or feminine pads) down the toilet. These will burn out the sewer pump and render the bathroom unusable. We provide low impact shampoo, conditioner, soap & body lotion and toilet paper and paper towels. There is a hair dryer and clothing iron. The cottage is also available for rent along with the main house if you have a larger party during the Holidays or Graduation.

We've spent the last four years turning this old house from a condemned eye-sore into a bright, modern home (when one spouse is a builder and the other an architect, you tend to take on house projects)! Given the location, you can't get much closer to everything downtown--so close to the downtown mall and the heart of Belmont. You can walk almost everywhere, but we also have two dedicated parking spots for guests, with other easy parking on the street. The house has an open downstairs floor plan with tall ceilings connecting the entry, living room, kitchen, dining room, mudroom, and one full bath. Upstairs contains four bedrooms comfortably sleeping up to 7 guests, 2 full baths (one is a master bath), and a sunny laundry/craft room.

Our neighborhood, Belmont, is the best! It's eclectic and diverse in every way, close to the Downtown Mall and UVA, and super walkable. The space My wife and I are old pros at hosting and have tailored our home to be inviting to new and old friends alike. Our common spaces are meant for socializing. We know the party happens in the kitchen, so we have a great island for cheeseboarding, and a lovely table for coffee talk or a group dinner. Our living room has the world's best leather sofa (nicknamed Violet Beauregard!) for relaxing while listening to records or catching Saturday Night Live after a night out. Outside, watch the neighborhood from the front porch swing, or cozy up to the fire pit on the back patio. The kitchen is well stocked with the essentials (coffee, tea, beer, condiments, etc) and we encourage you to make yourself totally at home. Cooks can rest assured that the pans and knives are good quality. Use the Vitamix to make cocktails or smoothies! The bedrooms all have memory foam mattresses (Leeza, Avocado, Zinni brands) and great bedding - nice cotton sheets, down comforters, fresh pillows - the works! The king and queen bedrooms are designed to be tranquil getaways, with spare furniture and art. The teen room will make you feel young again! The living room has a a trunk of bedding for potential sofa sleeping, and there's a twin-sized air mattress that can be thrown in any of the rooms. The bathroom features a heated bidet(!), nice towels, and good toiletries. Plus, we don't mind sharing the miscellaneous stuff that can be forgotten while traveling, like heartburn medicine or dry shampoo. Homebodies rejoice in the wide selection of entertainment options. The Apple TV has Netflix, HBOGo, Amazon Prime, YouTube TV, and other apps loaded and ready to go. We have a PS4, with a few games loaded up. Play board games, build with Lego, or put together a puzzle. We have hundreds of records spanning many decades and genres, or you can play your iTunes from the Apple TV. Cleanliness is very important to us - to protect guests and our own family. We clean laundry using an ionizer (like hospitals and hotels!) - we wash blankets and comforter covers between each guest, and wash pillows and down comforters monthly. We disinfect door knobs, light switches, remotes, and all other frequently touched items before each guest. We beat rugs in the sun and employ a robot army of Roombas to make sure there are no dust bunnies under the beds or sofa. We're big fans of the sterilize setting on the dishwasher.

The space Two blocks from Amtrak, impeccable accommodations situated halfway along the mile between Downtown Charlottesville & UVA's Lawn in a walkable, friendly neighborhood. The train station is close enough for an easy walk but not so close as to disturb. Butternut Cottage is a small, well-appointed urban home just off West Main Street. It's an easy walk to UVA and to Charlottesville's Downtown Mall, about 5 blocks in either direction. The free trolley stops just a few blocks away as well and can help you get to UVA, Scott Stadium, JPJ Arena, and more. The cottage is fully furnished and outfitted for your stay. There is wireless internet, basic cable TV plus Roku, radio receiver, and 5-CD player. Additionally, there is off-street parking, A/C, iron and board, and other amenities for your comfort. See a more complete list of equipment & supplies in Photo 22 of my listing. This is a non-smoking residence. Dogs may accompany guests with advanced permission and an additional cleaning fee of $60. (So sorry but I'm allergic to cats.) If you'll let me know in advance what kind of bread, cereal, milk, etc. you like, I'm happy to provide it, along with organic eggs, coffee, and teas. There are also plenty of condiments, spices, baking supplies, etc. (Although the bakeries around here are insanely good...) Food waste is important to me and since many guests dine out, I'll just pick up what works for you. The entire house, grounds, and driveway (along with a tag for street parking for a second car) are included in the price/rental. No more than 2 cars please! My neighbors are all great and ready to help if anything comes up. We have artists here, world-class fiddle players, IT experts, moms and babies, retirees, students, PHD candidates, you name it. I love the eclectic, friendly vibe here. Just a block up, on West Main Street, a free trolley travels back and forth between UVA and the Downtown Mall. Check the schedule for current times. Guest access The entire house and gardens are ready for your sole enjoyment, except for my small office, which is closed. This is a one-level home and, while the basement is not as guest-amenable as the main level, feel free to do an emergency load of clothes if needed. (NOTE: I keep a wireless cam on top of a clothes cabinet down there so I can monitor my sump pump in times of storms and possible power outage.) The garden is usually in a state of wild order, depending on the season and day of the week. If you have permission to bring a dog, note that a large dog could possibly escape over a 40 picket part of the fence right in front. *PLEASE keep dogs out of the flower beds and pick up after them daily. Other things to note IMPORTANT! I have a small 1-car driveway and a permit for street parking for 1 additional car. This is a very short street and my neighbors have very little parking to share among them. Please be respectful and do not allow guests to park cars on my street. If spaces are limited",you can park blocking my driveway as long as the next door neighbor can still get in and out. If you use the parking hang tag I provide and get a ticket for this maneuver,I'll pay it! Please select the $60 pet fee to let us know you plan to bring a dog (advanced permission required).

(Not taking traveling nurses yet unless they graduated from UVA). Private room and bathroom, own frig/freezer. We encourage cooking in our great kitchen! Large bright LR/dining rm. 4 UVA degrees in family but we’re out sailing sometimes! ON-SITE PARKING. UVA & City bus 1 blck. 15 min walk to Hospital (Madison/14th). Slowly updating outside so may look a bit ruddy! No smokers/vapors (even outside); we have no pets and sorry but no pet rule. The space Please make sure you’ve mapped our property. We shy away from people asking “how far is it to…” (unless you’re from overseas and need help) because it indicates they didn’t bother to read our descriptions herein where we have provided the most detail we’re permitted to give w/out giving out the actual address, which isn’t permitted (nor safe). This is a single family home. We live and work at home (mostly because our offices and bedroom are downstairs) but have lots going on. In the summer we are often off sailing a week here a week there. I’m a ‘84 and ‘13 graduate (past UVA engineering prof), w/ 2 alum millenials : ‘14 (engineering) at Intel in Oregon and ‘15 math major in NYC doing her hedge fund thing! So we have space to help rotating med students, interns and other UVA-affiliated visitors. No other people but us will be here renting while you’re here. Rarely but it happens, one or both of our 2 millennials will return for something and their rooms are on the other side from yours. (But they’re funny and smart and love meeting all those who’ve intersected with them when renting here!) These are your “location” hints for mapping but the circle on the map is indeed almost spot on. Our place is one long block from the Madison Street/Washington park UVA bus hub. Also a few steps from the City bus trolley. And a few houses off of famous Rugby Road (so we are between Rugby and Madison on Preston Ave.) Lots of parking in front on Preston but your spot is the one in front of the front door. Room: Private Queen bedroom and bathroom (shower). 1/2 size refridge w/ freezer (about 4 ft tall 1.5 ft wide so larger then a dorm fridge) in your own room for your food. Hi-speed wi-fi, basic cable TV in your room. Dresser, couch, small closet, queen-sized bed, allthe linens, blankets, comforter and pillow choices you could want/ get! Preston Avenue is a main 2-way 2-lane street with a light in the next block so you have access to everything in 3 directions (downtown historic mall 30 min walk south; to hospital/UVA Rotunda 15 min walk west; 20 min walk (north) to Barrack’s Rd shopping center all somewhat equi-distant). NOTE: if you're a light light sleeper, think about if this is for you. We just changed out all the windows in the house (2020) to beautiful double-paned windows but if you need absolute dead silence, even a bird chirp irritates you, this might require you to stay at a place farther out of town. Good news is you won’t hear any noise from us from in the house and it’s not an apartment building! Because we basically live and work downstairs. Central A/C / heat. Great kitchen with everything from sous vide to slow cooker to electric/ oven stove, blender, coffee every morning at 7 am by my husband. (Starbucks Morning Blend he grinds up at night when we’re here.) Keurig-type maker within the coffee machine available for your own K-Cups also. We love meeting new people but we expect you’re here to study or make classes and we respect that! If you’re here because you need to work at home, we’re unlikely to approve that as we aren’t looking for roommates. We work at home (downstairs) and always have. And the house is too small to accommodate those that will spend a bulk of their time in the house. But don’t hesitate to indicate your circumstances and ask. Guest access Front door access. Parking on premises right out front in upper parking lot next to my husband’s BMW. You come right in the front door. Gravel front parking lot (until we finish upgrading the outside of the property. We just dug out and had installed new drainage around entire property down 8 ft so if you’re looking for a beautiful outside of a house 2022-2023 probably aren’t the years! ) During your stay We live and work at home (office work) and have for years. So one of us is usually around, and we manage our real estate holdings. But we have a sail boat and travel also. We love it when our guest grabs their bowl of cereal or in the case of med students, microwaved meal and shares the large dining room table or spreads out their work there. But we also have many that get up in the dark morning hours and head to their rotations and get back very late who we don’t see much. Just let us know. Starbucks Coffee ground and made for all of us at 7 am by my husband. If we drink it all, we’ll make more! Full kitchen / cooking use expected and hoped for (like the Big Chill movie!) including use of all our condiments (but you get your own small fridge freezer in room for your items as fridge not big enough for both of us!) If you intend to have any family or guests come to town to see you (including drop off and pick up for those getting ferried here), you’ll need to book a hotel for them or in the case of a spouse or significant other you can stay with them there. This location is intended for people working hard to earn degrees or accreditations or teaching at UVA. And conjugal visits are really weird in a house this “cozy”. And, well, Covid. We’re fully vaxxed and boosted (a/o Oct 2021) and my husband had Omicron in Jan 2022. The rest is a crap shoot. We don’t care if you are vaxxed or not but we don’t wear masks in our home. The rest is your life your choice. However, if you do get Covid while here and have to be quarantined and stay home, we’re here and you can stay and ride it out. No problem. We’ll get you some chicken soup! Study or work right outside your door at the large dining room table. We’re rarely upstairs except for making meals and then taking them downstairs to eat, work or watch a movie ! But we share the living room, dining room, kitchen and that LR tv with you so that is considered “shared space” though we have duplicates of that downstairs. Back porch with table and chairs faces east for morning coffee if you’re so inclined and feel free to play the piano! Other things to note We love interesting people and we love helping UVA-bound rotaters coming to town. You can bike from here to UVA as we do for football and basketball games (10-15 minutes), and you can take the bus to UVA, the hospital. Or, you can just walk up Madison in about ~25 minutes to the UVA Hospital. We are equidistant to Barrack's Road Shopping Center as we are to Shenandoah Joe's. But if you're coming without a car like from another country which we get often, the city bus stop is a house away for groceries at Barrack's Road Kroger or Harris Teeter or you just get them delivered for your little refrigerator.",0.91,0.88,45,Strict,NULL,250,Favors UVA grad med student types queen w/ pvt BRm,4.96,,"{check_in"": ""2024-12-09""","check_out: ""2024-12-14""","CLEANING_FEE: {""total"": 45","currency: ""USD""}","ACCOMMODATION: {""total"": 625","currency: ""USD""}","AIRBNB_SERVICE_FEE: {""total"": 95","currency: ""USD""}","TOTAL_BEFORE_TAXES: {""total"": 765","currency: ""USD""}}""",882a8c11d7fffff,0,0,United States,Virginia,,22903,,0,https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/97ae491f-f7f6-41d8-8e32-8b08f2389b11.jpg,0,NULL,Penn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is constructed primarily from materials that have come from somewhere else and are getting a second life. It took over six years to collect the materials and use them in a thoughtful way.

Amenities include: - 2 renovated bathrooms with new flooring - master bath has a fully functional jetted jacuzzi tub - vaulted ceilings and skylights throughout - modern stainless steel kitchen featuring a Viking range - Bosch “Silent” dishwasher and brand new LG fridge - digital baby grand piano in living room - King bed is a 10 memory foam mattress that sits on a remote controlled adjustable base for the ultimate lazy Saturday experience - 55” Smart TV in living room on an articulating mount- easily watch your favorite show while cooking - 50” Smart TV in bedroom - spacious front balcony complete with a brand new stainless steel 4 burner grill and dining furniture. This balcony has 2 sides to it and doesn't have a divider- one side is for this condo and one side is for the neighbors. It feels very separate and the sides are easily defined - all of the windows/doors for this condo look out on this condo's ""side"" of the balcony",so it remains very private. - back balcony off the master with a table and 4 chairs- ideal if you want to rent the condo with a roomie- you can have your own private outdoor space. - brand new washer/dryer that is located in a separate room in the building and shared with one other condo (where a young professional couple lives). There is keypad access to the laundry area. You do have to go outside and around the building to access the laundry. The guest bedroom is tiny but functional. It has a brand new full size bed and it’s own closet. The guest bedroom also has a stairway up to a loft storage area. The owner will maintain this space for their own private storage. This is the perfect spot for entertaining a small group of friends; there is so much room indoors and outdoors to host! This condo comes with one paid parking space that is located in a lot on 10th street,about a half block from the condo. Parking is very limited in this area but there are almost always spots out front for the neighboring takeout restaurants where you can easily load/unload groceries,etc. A car is not necessary to have a great experience here as the area is incredibly walkabe and Instacart will deliver groceries from all major stores directly to your door! Please note that there is an Asian quick-service takeout restaurant located below. Their food is incredibly good (a few of the sushi rolls and their dumplings are my personal favorite along with a lot of great standard Chinese dishes). They are open 10am-10pm daily minus Tuesdays. There is not much noise associated since it is not a sitd-own restaurant but you will note the door sometimes closing hard below you if you're in the living room of the condo. From the bedroom you can occasionally hear the faint sound of pots and pans being moved around. This has never been bothersome for guests/tenants and the benefit of this building is your are not stacked with condos all around like most downtown apartments. There is only one apartment next door with a working professional couple. The best sound machines are provided in each bedroom that are incredibly effective in drowning out any nighttime downtown noise (from ambulances going to the hospital,etc). However,the positive of the location is you can walk out your doorstep and be at some of the best restaurants within minutes! Sorry,"no undergrads and absolutely no ""parties"" allowed.

HoneyHouse https://abnb.me/kisN2e1Tygb Or, zoom in map to see both listings. Honey B was built in 1959 as a workshop/storage shed. What you see now is basically two small storage spaces combined into one. Where the sofa now sits was a workbench with various tools hanging on a pegboard behind it. At the end of the bench, where the kitchen sink is now, there was a small wood-burning stove, the only source of heat. Originally the bench spanned the width of the building, separating it into two halves of what would become the Honey B. The back half, where the bedroom and bathroom are now, had a dirt floor and was open to the yard on one side. Exposed to the elements, after many years of disuse (or just plain neglect) the joists started to rot causing the roof to sag. During the renovation we raised the ceiling height by spanning the roof from the back wall to the top of the old shed. We feel like we arrived just in time to save it. We knocked down part of the cinderblock wall, connecting the two sides and closed up the open side of the building.

Perfect for weddings, bachelorette parties, families, and for groups exploring Cville. Our space is ideal for groups that would like to be close to downtown mall and UVA with easy access to highways to vineyards and shopping. Note: there is a basement apt with a separate entrance that is not included in this listing; if you would like full listing, you can find in my profile. The space Basics: 4 Bedrooms (2 Kings, 5 XL Twins), 3 full bathrooms, a large living area, dining room, open kitchen, a large deck, and large backyard. We provide local coffee and snacks. This 4 bedroom house is ideally located a mile from the Downtown mall and two miles from UVA. Our home stands out because we have a lot of space and a large backyard within the city limits. ***While we are excited for you to be in our home for your special occasion, we live on a very quiet and family friendly street and our neighbors do not allow loud noises past 9:30pm, so please consider this when booking. *** This home features a sunny, open kitchen, gas fireplace, back deck overlooking the Rivanna walking trails, and a newly finished basement with its own backyard entrance. We have four young children, so we have a kid-friendly home. We provide coffee, drinks, and snacks! The Main Floor: One of the things that made us fall in love with this house was the open concept of the main floor and all of the natural light that enters through the windows. It is easy to cook a meal in the kitchen while watching the game in the living room! One of the guest rooms is off of the kitchen and has a King-sized bed and a full bathroom attached to it. There is an open living room with huge, comfy couches, a dining area with a table that can fit 12, and a kitchen that are all open. The upstairs: The master bedroom has a king-sized bed, a XL twin-sized bed, and an attached master bathroom. The view outside the master bedroom is of the mountain that Monticello sits on! There are two guest bedrooms on the top floor--both with two twin XL-sized beds. There is another full bathroom and a washer and dryer on this floor. The backyard: The backyard is great because it is unusually large for a house being inside the Cville city limits. It's perfect for lawn games or some touch-football. We have a grill on our back deck (which is off of the main level) and the yard is perfect for a group BBQ or one of the lawn games we provide (corn hole, bocce ball, and croquet). Guest access Please help yourself to all necessary linens, toiletries, etc., which will be laid out for you upon arrival. In addition, you will have access to all diningware, spices, and cooking needs. Other things to note NO PARTIES: As a home in a residential neighborhood, we ask that only you and the listed guests spend time in our home during your stay (unless given special permission). Please be respectful of our neighbors by moving any activities indoors by 9:30pm and not playing loud music indoors after then. We have great neighbors, but they are very sensitive to noises since the houses are close together. BACHELORETTE PARTY RULES: While our above house policy states that there are no parties"" allowed",we're happy to welcome guests for a fun bachelorette weekend on a few simple conditions. Please do not invite additional guests beyond those who are staying in the house. We ask that you be respectful of the family-oriented neighborhood,being aware of your noise level,especially outdoors and at night between 9:30pm-7:30am. We ask that you respect the space and treat our home like your own. Beyond that,we're happy to accommodate bachelorette parties! TV: While we do not have cable television,our Fire TV will allow you to watch Netflix,Hulu,ESPN,Disney+,and Prime! Basement Unit Occupied by Owner: This listing includes the top two floors of the house (as described); the bottom floor will be occupied by me (and often my kids) and it has a separate,private entrance where there would not be overlap. If you are interested in renting the entire home,I have a separate listing for that. Not solely a vacation home: I am a seasoned host and know how to set up the home for a large group of guests. That being said,this is our personal home and is not as bare as a rental-only home (which we think is a benefit--all the kitchen supplies,board games,miscellaneous items you may need are available to you). All rooms have some or all dresser drawers dedicated to guests,"along with closet and hanging space. A couple overflow closets and the garage remain locked for the storage of our personal items.

We live in the upper part of the house and you will have an apartment we made in the basement. There is one bedroom with a queen size bed. And a large room that encompasses the living/dining/kitchen area. The bathroom is off of that room. It’s very quiet here in the woods, except for the serenade of birds and crickets. Will you see a bear? It’s very unlikely, but it is a rural setting in the woods. You are much more likely to see deer and rabbits and many birds.

Lucy is still very much a puppy and gets very excited to meet new people. I apologize if she tries to jump on you. She is in training and if she is a nuisance please let us know and we will put her up. We also have an aviary with finches. Please let us know if you’d like a look at them.

This stunning lake front home evokes Virginia's 18th C. architectural heritage, updating it with playful design. Serene, plush bedrooms, luxurious bathrooms. Billiards room, Fire pit, fish pond, sunroom, patios and porches, garage. Lakefront with trails. Perfect for multi-family groups. The space This stunningly unique, architectural home is the perfect backdrop for your special occasions, family getaways, or even your small group trips. It can sleep 15, but 5 or 6 people will also be supremely comfortable with 4 king beds, one queen, and 4 twins, plus crib & two rollaways. There are a variety of interesting spots to gather and plenty of areas to make memories including: 🎱 Billiards Room 🌸Outdoor Courtyard with a reflecting pool 🌤️All Seasons Sun Room with amazing view 🐠 Patio with fire pit with views of lake and mountains and so much more! KITCHEN + DINING 🍳The large, fully stocked kitchen has ample granite countertop space and everything you need to cook meals: • Dinnerware and Flatware for 15 people • Pots, pans, small appliances, spices, and cooking oils • Children’s plastic plates, flatware, and cups • Aluminum Foil, cling film, and Ziplocks • Garbage bags, cleaning supplies, and paper towels 🍝When it’s time to eat, there is a generous 6-person dining table in the kitchen, and an extra “kids” bistro table with two chairs and one highchair. The formal dining room (just through the butler’s pantry) seats 10 people comfortably. The Sunroom is also off the kitchen for additional dining space. THE BUTLER'S PANTRY The butler's pantry is a sweet little space between the kitchen and dining room. It offers plenty of things to use when you are feeling like a ☕ Barista : • Keurig single serve brewer, with Pods to get your started • Traditional coffee maker for a 12-cup pot of coffee, with ground coffee to get you started • French press • Pour Over • Coffee Bean Grinder • Filters • Dairy Frother • Sweeteners • Powdered Creamers • Tea Bags • Tea Infusers The butler's pantry also offers plenty of things to use when you are feeling like a 🥃 Bartender: • Stemless White Wine Glasses • Stemless Red Wine Glasses • Stemless Champagne Flutes • Stemless Martini Glasses • Cocktail Shakers • Wine and Beer Openers • Large Beverage Tub LIVING ROOM The natural light-filled living room has a vaulted ceiling and walls of large windows to enjoy the lake and mountain views outside. There is plenty of comfy seating to lounge or 🎲 play games together, or do a puzzle🧩. (And there are plenty of games and puzzles!) There is a 50” SmartTV with a ROKU to enjoy the same streaming services you have at home with our lightning fast wifi (please note: this home does not have a cable service provider). Amenities in the living room are: • Jigsaw Puzzles • Games for all ages • Children’s books • Lego Sets & more • A sprawling library of literature to peruse WIFI & WORKSPACE 🛜The internet connectivity is blazing fast at an average of 146Mbps, which was a herculean effort in this vast country estate. There are two bedrooms that offer spacious desks if you need to find a quiet place to work. VERY PRIVATE BEDROOMS The layout is perfect for 2 or 3 family groups. With five bedrooms, three on the main level and two on the upper level, none of them share a wall with each other, which provides maximum comfort and privacy under one roof. 🛌The North Bedroom (sleeps 2) is located on the main level, nearest to the kitchen. It has the largest ensuite bathroom. It is handsomely furnished with a King size bed, TV, large desk, and generous walk-in closet. 😴The South Bedroom (sleeps 2) is located on the main level, nearest to the garage. It is handsomely furnished with a King size bed and a comfy seating area and large closet. It has a “jack and jill” style bathroom with two entrance points. That bathroom would also be used by those sleeping in The Loft. 🛌The East Bedroom (sleeps 2) is located on the upper level. The smallest bedroom in the house, it’s still roomy, and handsomely furnished with a King size bed, and built in for storage. Its ensuite is a “jack and jill” style bathroom that is shared with the other upper level bedroom: The West Bedroom. 😴The West Bedroom (sleeps 2) is the other bedroom located on the upper level. Generously sized and handsomely furnished with a King size bed, it has a desk that provides an excellent workspace. This bedroom has the best lake views. Its ensuite is a “jack and jill” style bathroom that is shared with the East Bedroom. 🛌The Loft (sleeps 6) is located on the main level, tucked away past the foyer. Although quite elegant, this is the unofficial “kid’s bedroom”. There are two levels in the loft: on the main level there are two sets of twin bunk beds, as well as built-in drawers for storage. The upper level of the loft has a queen size bed** and a dresser. Those sleeping in the loft would walk down the hall to use the “jack and jill” style bathroom that connects to the South Bedroom. **Weight Limits in the Loft🏋🏽 Although this is the “kid’s bedroom” that doesn't mean adults cannot sleep in here, but for safety reasons weight is an important consideration: Manufacturer recommendation for the bunk beds is no greater than a 175 lbs load on the top bunk, and no greater than 200 lbs for the bottom bunk. Although the queen bed on the upper level of the loft is quite sturdy, the upper level of the loft in general has a weight limit of 500lbs.** ADDITIONAL SLEEPING OPTIONS • Two Rollaway Twin Beds that would be appropriate for children or teens to sleep on. These beds have a rather thin mattress and are not comfortable for an adult. • One Queen Size Air Mattress that inflates and deflates at the press of a button, this air mattress can be located in the walk-in closet of the North Bedroom. • One Guava Family Portable Crib for families traveling with a little one👶. It’s like a pack-n-play but far easier to set up/break down. There is a crib sheet with it, but only one, so we do suggest bringing a spare crib sheet. This can also be located in the walk-in closet of the North Bedroom. BATHROOMS + LAUNDRY This exquisite home has three full bathrooms and one half bathroom. All the bathrooms have been thoughtfully redesigned and fully renovated in the Summer of 2024. We supply a generous amount of toilet paper that is safe for septic systems, so please be mindful of only flushing approved items and not wipes, tampons, pads, or makeup removing towelettes, even if they say “flushable”🤦🏽‍♀️. The included amenities are: • Toilet Paper • Hand Soap • Shampoo • Conditioner • Body Wash • Linens: Hand Towels, Bath Towels, and Wash Cloths 🛁The North Bathroom is the ensuite of the North Bedroom. It has a walk in shower (with a 6”curb height), a freestanding jacuzzi tub, double sinks, and a dedicated vanity. 🚿The Main Level Jack and Jill Bathroom is the ensuite of the South Bedroom. It has a walk-in shower (with a 6”curb height) and a second entrance from the hall so that those guests that sleep in the Loft can use this bathroom. 🛁The Upstairs Jack and Jill Bathroom is the ensuite of both the East Bedroom and West Bedroom. It has a tub shower combo, and two dedicated sink areas to allow a little more space and privacy despite being a shared bathroom. This bathroom also has built in storage that serves a dresser as well as a very spacious linen closet. 🚾A Powder Room is directly located off the kitchen. It’s beautifully decorated, but not much else to say here besides it’s gorgeous and functional. 🧺The Laundry Room is on the main level and has large capacity machines that are available for guest use, as well as a full size refrigerator/freezer to store additional perishables and beverages that do not fit in the refrigerator in the kitchen. The included amenities are: • Laundry Detergent • OxyClean • Cleaning Supplies • First Aid Kit • Iron and ironing board • Dyson Stick Vacuum PETS Up to 2 well-behaved dogs are welcome in our home, but please note that there is no fence around the property. Also, even though our team thoroughly cleans between stays, consider our pet-friendly policy if you are highly allergic to dogs. 🐶 We provide two sets of food/water bowls. OUTDOOR LIVING SPACES Our property is a dedicated wildlife preserve🐝. Our native plants attract butterflies, lizards, deer, birds, and of course about one million squirrels. 🌳There is so much natural beauty to be enjoyed from any of our three very nice outdoor patios to sit on, as well as: • A beautiful reflecting pool in the courtyard • A propane fueled gas firepit table that overlooks the lake • A patio space with party lights and a propane fueled heating tower to warm up your group during the cooler months • A very comfortable, well-appointed 3-seasons room with sweeping lake and mountain views • A nearby walking trail to stroll past the lake PARKING A long, private driveway leads you to the house. There is comfortable parking available for 6-8 cars🚘, in front of the attached garage as well as around the circular driveway. The driveway offers ample and accessible space for a limo or larger transportation vehicles to pick up and drop off guests for winery, brewery, and other local tours. There is also a Tesla Level 2 60 amp charger available for guests to charge their electric vehicles. 🔌 EV charger is located inside the attached 2 car garage. Guest access When you book our home, you get access to the entire home. Now that that's clear, here's an overview of all the things in the area you will have access to.

It’s a beautiful, nature-filled setting that is the perfect backdrop to restoring your soul, recharging your battery, and reconnecting with the people and things in life that truly matter. This area of Virginia, specifically Nelson County, is the ultimate four-season vacation destination in the US because it has so much to offer, for people of all ages. If you have never been, you should move it to the top of your list!💌 WHAT YOU WON’T HAVE ACCESS TO: Although we are homeowners at Wintergreen, we are not members of the resort and we cannot offer our guests access to certain Wintergreen Resort Amenities up on the mountain such as: ⛔ Wintergreen Resort Gym ⛔ Indoor pool and hot tub ⛔ Fishing in any of the resort owned lakes That being said, in our opinion, Boars Head Resort has superior facilities, a better full-service spa, and they offer day passes to the public, which Wintergreen Resort does not. And there is great fishing (with a Va license) in our local rivers and lakes. WHAT YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS TO: The Wintergreen Resort is 14 miles up the mountain from our home (23 minute drive). Our guests do have access to the following Wintergreen attractions & more details and applicable fees can be found through Wintergreen’s official website. ✅Winter Sports like Skiing, Snowboarding, and Snow Tubing ✅Two outdoor community pools; one in the valley and one on the mountain ✅Lake Monacan Beach (1 mile trail walk, or 3 mile drive) ✅Stoney Creek Golf Course (2.4 miles, 6 minutes) ✅Devil's Knob Golf Course (14 miles, 23 minutes) ✅Tennis Courts ✅Pickleball Courts ✅The Treehouse Other things to note There’s no such thing as a perfect home, each one has their quirks and our vacation home is no different. Here’s a couple quirky things to note that should be considered before booking: 🪜The microwave in the kitchen is installed higher than average. If you are under 5’6” tall you may find it difficult to use. 💦The house is on Well Water. There are two considerations regarding well water: Unlike being hooked up to town or city water, our water gets pumped into a water tank in the house. Be wise with your water usage, if you use too much water at once you will notice a drop in pressure and you will need to wait for the well-pump to replenish the supply. 🧻 The house has a Septic System. Please respect that and do not flush any tampons or wipes (even if they say flushable). 🐻 Our property is a Certified Wildlife Habitat""",which means we respect all the animals in the area and if some want to make a shelter for themselves on our land,we are fine with that . This includes: Birds,bunnies,lizards,deer,snakes,foxes,badgers,bears,and others. If you have an extreme phobia of wildlife please be advised you may see wild animals on the land surrounding our home,as well as the area in general. 🚨As a safety feature,the smoke detectors are hard-wired to alert Wintergreen Fire & Rescue if they are activated. This optimizes response time in case of an emergency,"BUT the ""no-smoking and vaping inside the home or garage"" policy needs to be respected because smoking near any of the units will set it off; this has happened.""",0.85,0.75,350,Firm,NULL,0,Luxury in Wintergreen Valley • Lake View • EV• 151,5,,"{check_in"": ""2024-12-31""","check_out: ""2025-01-05""","CLEANING_FEE: {""total"": 350","currency: ""USD""}","ACCOMMODATION: {""total"": 3657","currency: ""USD""}","LONG_STAY_DISCOUNT: {""total"": -366","currency: ""USD""}","TOTAL_BEFORE_TAXES: {""total"": 3641","currency: ""USD""}}""",882a8c46b9fffff,2,0,United States,Virginia,,22958,,1,https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-598010835490925988/original/0127685c-824d-41f5-bc5b-413c303311e5.jpeg,0,NULL,Elise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is incorrect! It is a new subdivision and some GPS apps have not caught up! The street address is 3603 Moffat St, Charlottesville, VA 22902. Fun things to do: - A tour of Monticello- President Thomas Jefferson’s historic home is a must see. There are several good vineyards to go to as well in this area. During the busy season – fall, summer and spring it is best to call and get a reservation at this UNESCO World Heritage Site. During the holiday season Monticello is decked out with traditional colonial decorations -US president James Monroe Highland and US President James Madison historic homes are also very good. There are wonderful vineyards in these locations as well. - Carter’s Mountain up the street is near Monticello is a very popular destination. - the Farmers market(spring through fall only)on the downtown mall is amazing! - My personal favorite vineyards are Pipin Hill Farm and vineyard, Dave Matthew’s Blenheim Vineyard, Albemarle Estate at Trump vineyard.

There are too many places to list, but a convenient, nearby trail is Saunders-Monticello trail which is very nice. -Touring UVA/Thomas Jefferson’s Rotunda. Reservations required, but worth it!

Lunch: Red Hub Barbecue(parking is difficult, but worth it), Wayside takeout, Mezeh mediterranean grill, Poke Sushi, Mellow mushroom pizza, Monsonsoon Siam(Thai), Milan(Indian). Any of the sushi places on the downtown mall are excellent. There are also chain restaurants: Chipotle, Panerra etc. *** Near Pipin Hill Farms is a pizza place called Dr. Ho’s which serves up some of the best pizza in town. If you want to do just wine tasting at Pipen, Dr. Ho’s is a great spot for pizza afterwards. ***Michie Tavern is a historic tavern with a period restaurant serving Southern fare, plus a gift shop & tours at Monticello. The current hours are limited from 11:30 – 3 pm. This tavern was a favorite spot of Thomas Jefferson and is right next to Monticello. It’s a bit pricey for what you get, but it’s fun! Dinner: Maya’s , Orzos, The Wool Factory(new), Ten(sushi), Tavola, the Local, Zocalos, Continental Divide, Red Pump Kitchen, and Brasserie Saison. *** Mas (Mas is a Spanish eatery offering tapas & great spanish wines in an industrial-chic setting with a lively bar.

You can go into the large vegetable garden but keep gates closed. (Deer are awaiting entrance whenever there is an opportunity! Bunnies dine in the garden, at will.) You will see another expansive garden/patio area but it is still being renovated so best to avoid that until complete. There is a mowed path around the edges of the property that you are welcome to walk. Please avoid the family areas - front and back porch areas. Other things to note We are on a rural road and there are no street lights to light your way at night. We do have solar lights at the entrance and leading up to the apartment so there should be no trouble finding your way. Noise: When we are home, we live above the apartment so you may hear our quiet footfall. It's fun to see wildlife in the field, turkey, deer, fox... something to note about the fox is their communication style - a loud shrill scream - just them getting to know each other. . . :) There is some solar electric fence around the sheep pasture. Best to avoid. Not a very strong charge but not comfortable if you touch it. And don't go in the pasture with the sheep. Though friendly, these male sheep will express that by butting you, hard, with their horns.

The living area opens to a serene screened porch overlooking the views for bug-free outdoor living. The kitchen opens to the dining area and boasts new appliances, All Clad cookware, cooking staples, a Vitamix, a cool mid-century vibe, lots of cabinet space, and a view of the beautiful and historic neighborhood the home is nestled amidst. Off of the living area is the bedroom wing of the first floor, containing three bedrooms: a primary bedroom with beautiful sunset views and attached half bath, and an additional two bedrooms (one with a queen bed and one with a full) and a newly-renovated full bath with tub/shower combo. All bedrooms have large closets. Downstairs, you’ll find a large family room overlooking the views with smart TV, comfortable furniture to lounge in, a desk for working, plenty of built-in bookshelves, a games table, a yoga mat and yoga supplies, and hand weights. A door from the family room leads out to the back patio with comfortable seating around a propane fire pit, a gas Weber grill, and an outdoor dining table- all positioned to take in the quiet, private yard and the ever-changing view. Also downstairs you’ll find the laundry room with washer and dryer/second kitchen (a cafe kitchen with refrigerator, sink, microwave and toaster oven- no range) and two bedrooms (one with a king bed and one with a single bed). The single bedroom doubles as a home office with a desk and a pretty sunset view. There is also a newly renovated full bath with shower/tub combo on this level. The house is set in a sought-after, well established neighborhood that is home to college professors, retirees, and young professional families. It is a very popular road for walkers and runners because of its historic architecture, lack of traffic, and natural beauty. UVA is walkable or bikeable- one mile to the stadium- and there are numerous great restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. Nature trails, a river, and walking and mountain biking opportunities abound literally right outside both the front and back doors.

Other things to note Recent review from another platform Mary P Thu",Apr 13 – Mon,Apr 17,"2023 Vrbo 5/5 Secluded Getaway This property is beautiful! Very secluded and peaceful. It was very well equipped and had a very warm and comfortable feeling. There were wineries and breweries in the area that we visited and enjoyed. This was a getaway with my brother and sister-in-law from South Carolina (we’re from PA). If was a perfect mid way point and we all were very happy with the cabin.

But- with that comes a few things to note- For accessibility purposes for wine tours,we ask that you walk to the end of Woodfolk Drive to pick up your wine tour bus/coach at the corner of Woodfolk and Baylor Lane. Don't worry- this is less than a 1 minute walk! It is just out of consideration for our coach company drivers. Since the street has parking on one side and is narrow there's no way to have a large vehicle safely turn around down at the house. If you let us know your coach company before/after it is booked,we are happy to personally call them and explain the set up! Parking- There is one pull-in spot and then 2 more cars can pull directly behind. This is all private parking. The rest of the parking will need to be done on the street which isn't an issue but we do require you to be mindful of a few things: 1) Fire hydrant located near the house- 15 feet of clearance before and after it. 2) You can't stack cars in the roadway even though it is a dead-end. In the event that the fire company/EMS ever needed to access the house,they need to be able to get to the end of the road where the house is. All parking must be done on the righthand side when coming in. 3) Consideration for neighbors- we will leave some detailed instructions but you won't have any trouble parking multiple cars- we just ask you to be kind and mindful of our lovely neighbors! Don't park directly behind their pull-in driveways as it makes it difficult for them to get out. Late night noise- YES,we absolutely want you to have fun! However,we do require any outside/outdoor noise to die down after 10PM. This is just a general Good Neighbor Policy. A substantiated complaint or 2 from neighbors can have us shut down- eek! The neighbors all have my phone number and have been instructed to just contact us if they ever feel like they are being overly disrupted by our guests who come between when the owners stay. While we hope this isn't an issue,"it's best to be prepared! If I do send you a text saying ""Hey","y'all! Heard you're having a great time- can we please move the party inside since it's getting very late? Or limit it to ""fireside chatter"" outside?"" Please know we are just trying to be great neighbors and we will not reach out unless absolutely necessary! :)""",,,215,Strict,NULL,0,"Trendy, Mountain Views, Close to Downtown",5,,"{check_in"": ""2024-12-21""","check_out: ""2024-12-26""","CLEANING_FEE: {""total"": 215","currency: ""USD""}","ACCOMMODATION: {""total"": 3975","currency: ""USD""}","AIRBNB_SERVICE_FEE: {""total"": 592","currency: ""USD""}","TOTAL_BEFORE_TAXES: {""total"": 4782","currency: ""USD""}}""",882a8c0245fffff,2,0,United States,Virginia,Ridge St.,22903,,1,https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/prohost-api/Hosting-815312850918778272/original/fd32e67c-60bf-4302-a8d6-4d1fe8b2ce3e.jpeg,0,NULL,Becky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This guest cabin is located at the Outstandish Farm on the north side of Charlottesville, VA. The cabin is situated on 80 gorgeous acres that include walking/biking trails, a creek, and lots of room to play. We have chickens and guinea fowl and a friendly farm dog. The animals will all try to convince you to let them sleep inside the cabin with you, but please don't! While we love animals, we like to keep the cabin animal-free. The space The cabin is a cozy one and a half story design, with the master bedroom being in the loft. While the loft and stairs have a sturdy railing, the cabin was built in the 70's, and the safety code was not the same as it is today (primarily the space allowed between rails). Please look at the pictures and use your judgement if you are booking with young children. The kitchen comes stocked with all the cooking equipment you will need, if you desire to cook your own meals--even a blender and food processor! We often have traveling nurses stay here for 12 weeks at a time so it is set up with everything you would expect for day-to-day cooking--not just the bare minimum. Outside, there is a run-down, but mostly functional tennis court and basketball hoop that you are welcome to use. Just a warning, that our boys (ages 9 and 11) may come out and ask to play with you, especially if they see kids. Feel free to cool off in the creek behind the cabin, or even test your hand at gold-panning. Did you know that prior to the California Gold Rush, this region was a hot spot for gold-mining?

Our 11 comfortable suites are the perfect place to unwind after a day of vineyard hopping or attending a wedding or event on-site. Be our guest! The property holds a rich history that traces back to its original owner,Dr. Charles Everett. This esteemed physician had the honor of serving as the personal physician for not just one,but three American Presidents: Jefferson,Madison,and Monroe. However,it was his close friendship with Thomas Jefferson that truly shaped the legacy of the estate. Together,they would venture from their separate residences in Charlottesville,Monticello,and the Belmont Tract to this very location,formerly known as Upland Manor. It was here that they would find solace in the serene surroundings and revel in the bountiful opportunities for hunting and fishing. We gladly paid homage to the esteemed Dr. Everett by bestowing his name upon the estate that now stands as a testament to his incredible legacy. While the property has changed hands multiple times throughout its history,its most recent iteration was as a thriving Bed and Breakfast called The Mark Addy Inn. Renowned for its exceptional accommodations and on-site restaurant,The Mark Addy Inn fostered a sense of community in Nelson County for countless years. However,under new ownership,the inn embarked upon a meticulous and respectful restoration process completed by Becky Seager of WKNDR Design in Charlottesville,culminating in an opulent boutique experience that can cater to up to 125 guests for weddings and events.

The space There is a nice front porch with beautiful Mountain Views, a huge grass backyard with nice swing set, 3 fire pit areas with comfy outdoor seating areas. There is also a small river on the property so you can hear water running and are welcome to swim or fish in when it's deep. (The depth fluctuates depending on rainfall and season) There are 3 acres of yard with a small back deck and 3 different firepit areas with comfortable seating! Also the front covered porch is nice to sit on and view the mountains. One of the firepits is gas, the others are for burning wood. There is Corn Hole set for you to play and a Charcoal Grill and Smoker!

Firewood, charcoal, lighter fluid, propane or other fire starters are not provided. If you would like to use the firepits or charcoal grill, please bring all the supplies you would need for this.

If firepits or charcoal grill are used by guest, you are responsible for cleaning them after use so it's ready for next guest. The cleaning crew does not clean firepits or grill.

I want guests to be able to check-in as early as possible. Due to the large amount of linens to be laundered between guests and the short amount of time do it, the washer/dryer will often have linens in them so that another load can run after cleaner leaves. You are welcome to use the washer/dryer, but will sometimes have to take out a load in order to do so. If you specifically know you will use the washer/dryer during your stay and don't want to have to do this, please let me know prior to check-in and I'll tell my cleaner to leave them empty for you.

Guest access All self check-in- guests will be provided with a unique code that opens the front door and the door to their suite. Other things to note The property holds a rich history that traces back to its original owner,Dr. Charles Everett. This esteemed physician had the honor of serving as the personal physician for not just one,but three American Presidents: Jefferson,Madison,and Monroe. However,it was his close friendship with Thomas Jefferson that truly shaped the legacy of the estate. Together,they would venture from their separate residences in Charlottesville,Monticello,and the Belmont Tract to this very location,formerly known as Upland Manor. It was here that they would find solace in the serene surroundings and revel in the bountiful opportunities for hunting and fishing. We gladly paid homage to the esteemed Dr. Everett by bestowing his prestigious name upon the estate that now stands as a testament to his incredible legacy. While the property has changed hands multiple times throughout its history,its most recent iteration was as a thriving Bed and Breakfast called The Mark Addy Inn. Renowned for its exceptional accommodations and on-site restaurant,The Mark Addy Inn fostered a sense of community in Nelson County for countless years. However,under new ownership,the inn embarked upon a meticulous and respectful restoration process,both inside and out,culminating in an opulent boutique experience for by-the-night travelers and the ability to rent the whole estate for weddings and events. The rejuvenated design not only pays respect to a bygone era,but also reflects modern sensibilities by showcasing an array of vibrant and unique guest rooms,elegant common areas,and a complete revitalization of the surrounding grounds. These elements are masterfully intertwined through an enchanting color scheme and recurring patterns,ultimately creating an ambiance that captivates guests and transports them to an enchanting era of the past,"with a contemporary twist.

Both bathrooms have bathtubs. The living room has a couch and a chair that face the Sony TV. Basic cable is offered,so just primary stations,including CBS,NBC,ABC,and Fox. The internet box is located behind the couch. There are plates and glasses available in the cupboard and silverware and cooking utensils in the drawers. I would ask that you not use the dishwasher,but rather hand wash any plates or just leave them dirty in the dishwasher. The main thermostat is located in the hallway between the 2 bedrooms. I normally keep the temperature at 75,but feel free to adjust slightly higher or lower according to preference.

Guest access All self check-in- guests will be provided with a unique code that opens the front door and the door to their suite. Other things to note The property holds a rich history that traces back to its original owner,Dr. Charles Everett. This esteemed physician had the honor of serving as the personal physician for not just one,but three American Presidents: Jefferson,Madison,and Monroe. However,it was his close friendship with Thomas Jefferson that truly shaped the legacy of the estate. Together,they would venture from their separate residences in Charlottesville,Monticello,and the Belmont Tract to this very location,formerly known as Upland Manor. It was here that they would find solace in the serene surroundings and revel in the bountiful opportunities for hunting and fishing. We gladly paid homage to the esteemed Dr. Everett by bestowing his prestigious name upon the estate that now stands as a testament to his incredible legacy. While the property has changed hands multiple times throughout its history,its most recent iteration was as a thriving Bed and Breakfast called The Mark Addy Inn. Renowned for its exceptional accommodations and on-site restaurant,The Mark Addy Inn fostered a sense of community in Nelson County for countless years. However,under new ownership,the inn embarked upon a meticulous and respectful restoration process,both inside and out,culminating in an opulent boutique experience for by-the-night travelers and the ability to rent the whole estate for weddings and events. The rejuvenated design not only pays respect to a bygone era,but also reflects modern sensibilities by showcasing an array of vibrant and unique guest rooms,elegant common areas,and a complete revitalization of the surrounding grounds. These elements are masterfully intertwined through an enchanting color scheme and recurring patterns,ultimately creating an ambiance that captivates guests and transports them to an enchanting era of the past,"with a contemporary twist.

Also the front covered porch is nice to sit on and view the mountains. One of the firepits is gas, the others are for burning wood.

Firewood, charcoal, lighter fluid, propane or other fire starters are not provided. If you would like to use the firepits or charcoal grill, please bring all the supplies you would need for this. One firepit is gas powered and uses a refillable propane tank. If this tank is empty and you wish to use this firepit, you are welcome to bring the empty tank to a local propane tank retailer to switch out for a full tank and reinstall. If firepits or charcoal grill are used by guest, you are responsible for cleaning them after use so it's ready for next guest. The cleaning crew does not clean firepits or grill.

Due to the large amount of linens to be laundered between guests and the short amount of time do it, the washer/dryer will often have linens in them so that another load can run after cleaner leaves. You are welcome to use the washer/dryer, but will sometimes have to take out a load in order to do so. If you specifically know you will use the washer/dryer during your stay and don't want to have to do this, please let me know prior to check-in and I'll tell my cleaner to leave them empty for you. Only the number of guests that you book for are allowed on the property at any time.

Enjoy this calm, stylish and private space, centrally located for convenient access to all things Charlottesville. We are located in a quiet and family oriented neighborhood with mature trees and wooded trails within walking distance. The space Our studio apartment is attached to our home and is a separate and private space. It is generally quite quiet since it has double built walls and ceiling with blown in insulation. Our family does reside in the attached home so it's possible you may occasionally hear us in the yard (which we reserve for our families use) or on rare occasions some sound from inside the house. Our families living spaces are on the opposite side of the attached home and there is little to no sound transfer. We strive to be respectful of our guests space and privacy at all times. This is a ground level space. There are no living quarters above or below. As this is a neighborhood, you may hear children playing and/or lawns being mowed and you'll likely see walkers, joggers and bike riders around the neighborhood. I strive to use non-toxic cleaners and keep a space that is clean and chemical free. I use an air purifier between guests and leave it in the space for your use if you wish. A selection of cozy, non-slip slipper socks are available in order to help you feel at home and to help keep the soft, plush wool rug clean and comfortable for all. There is a queen size bed with cotton sheets and an all season down duvet and down pillows. If you have a need for down alternative options please let me know in advance. The space is ideally suited to singles and couples. For an additional fee I will provide an air mattress and bedding for a 3rd person. The space is not suitable for young children and is a pet free space. Guest access You will have the entire studio apartment space to yourself with separate entrance. This includes a small, private deck with privacy fence and seating, accessible through the French doors at the rear of the apartment. The driveway and your parking space are right outside of your front door and a keyless entry allows for ease of arrival and settling in at your convenience.

There are many critically acclaimed restaurants all within a 1 minute walk of the place. Designed in a rustic bohemian style, this place definitely represents Charlottesville! Please note $150 pet fee per pet (more for stays more than 4 nights) to be paid after booking. The space This is a roughly 700 square foot 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment with a living room and a bonus room (dining room/seating space). It has a huge balcony with an additional 250 square feet of space, with a view overlooking Downtown Belmont. PLEASE READ: This is an Historic older building so please keep in mind while it has tons of rustic bohemian charm, this is by no means new or modern. The entry stairway leading to unit and the common entryway foyer are quite run down and old looking. There are nicks and marks on walls and floor of unit. It only shares floor with one unit, and part of the kitchen wall with a side unit (bedroom does not share wall with neighbor), but you can hear muffled sounds from neighbors (as they can hear you), akin to most apartment buildings without concrete or brick walls. It is clean, very inviting and nice-looking, but if you are looking for new quality with few imperfections, this is not it.
